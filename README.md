Skillable TV
============

_This project is no longer maintained and part of my source code "attic". Feel free to use it though, works fine._

SKTV transforms a list of videos into a television, forever repeating. This was a project which started in 2011 that never got finished, the idea is similar to synchtube, which now seems to no longer exist. It also has the same functionality for the end user (you â€“ as the viewer), just like synchtube does. All you can do is watch what you get, just like a television channel.
